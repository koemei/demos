Hi welcome to get real with when I I'm a host when a T. V. and today we're getting real which opal it see the founder of content marketing institute let's just see what you have to say oh so how to the starfield like just walking through how did you get the idea of starting content marketing and steered back in two thousand inside seven and how are things of all persons that So

I I grew from publishing started in attending media in two thousand and ten is the largest independent be to be publisher. And I my first role there was in the content marketing departments call pending custom media at the time so what we did is we had sales reps out there selling all kinds advertising programs and when they couldn't sell advertising it through grass and said maybe you can sell something and we worked on what our programs video programs across the magazines anymore work can help companies tell their own stories in order to attract an audience which was in happening in pockets it wasn't something that serious but as I went. And the selling to enough to marketing officers in talking about it and as I saw social media really come into play a supply in order for brands to get attention they're going to need to start creating more relevant content that really hits home with their audience base. And so we said okay well maybe there's an opportunity there so lost what is not content marketing institute two thousand seven have always wanna start a business. So so why not this one and really thought it was a pain point we were just in the first two years I gotta be honest with you were rocky. I we didn't know if we're gonna make it we're bleeding casket we're focusing on more a matching program but the initial idea for condom marketing institute was it your brand and you have a content need we will match you up with an agency or freelancer that can offer those services there's a lot of people doing that now today but at the time there was nobody doing it. But we were to really do the game because most the marketers we're coming saying look I don't need content services right now what I need to do is any the strategy I need training or can you come in and and do a workshop for in the in the company and I'm like finally in two thousand nine it hit us hard enough to say look that's the direction we re go and all around education so we didn't have it two thousand nine two thousand ten formally launched the website cheap cots an officer magazine condom marketing world happen in two thousand eleven. And thankfully that was the right decision because what and still today we still real the the biggest issue now that everybody's talking about content marketing the biggest issue we have is there's none of education out there we need more education we need more training there's basically silos that are creating content they're not talking to each other organisations and we have to be there is sorta help guide them and hopefully we are and and hopefully we're we're doing a good job at it how

do you determine what the right mixes in terms of different types of content and where it should go "'cause" there's a bunch of things you can do when you guys are doing a bunch of those things in terms of park ass and magazines and you know creating video content. But for companies that are not there yet with their content strategy. They decide where they should focus the reference

it's a really good question and the important thing to realise is that if you're looking at a framework for content marketing channel selection is like steps up. Um most organisations don't even have a documented strategy. So and we know what is the critical indicators for success it's there's two things this one is do I have a documented strategy into M. I. following. So very simple right it's super simple but most of those are doing that but if you're asking me how can I be more successful start there then what I do that I figure why am I doing this am I trying to drive sales about trying to save costs about trying to create happy customers keep the more loyal okay great who's the particular audience really really hard for me to be companies in particular "'cause" they're targeting you'd be targeting the people that are involved in that buying process and some way you can target all eight you have to target one or two so start really focused on that and then as you doing the research about what are the audience needs what's our mission statement like an editorial mission let's create a mission statement what we do all those types of things that we get into what what channel's make the most sense. So that's where I would just say do the upfront work. Now. I'm a big believer in the three legged stool philosophy for publishing a size that come from a publishing background I believe and that that means that I wanna look at how do we integrate in person communications with digital with with bright even print I think still as a role today. So wanna look at that and I don't want to just say okay well I need to be a digital digital probably needs to be prime or no doubt about it. But I think there's opportunities and both like for example you we talked about before we're launching a park S. network. Why we lodging up I guess that work because it's easier to cut through the clutter broadcast video park as those types of things really big opportunity there because we're seeing a lot of them and for those things as there's it's easier to get the download a video broadcaster regular broadcast today than ever before but there's not enough competition there and that as much. So there's an opportunity that's why I believe there's an opportunity imprint because nobody's feeling it. They they've all gone digital. So I'm just trying to how can I cut through the clutter how can I make the most impact of course are blog is the centre point of that and we integrate audio and video into our blogger sort of our main how because I want regular subscribers. So I guess that's what a long story short when you're looking to channel strategy I would really say what is your audience development strategy what is your subscriber strategy "'cause" what I wanna know is I wanna get subscribers. And I wanna keep them. And then at the end of the day when I look at all the data I wanna say well what's the difference between people that subscribe to my content gauge it versus those that don't that that's like that's your home around that that will tell you everything you need to know about whether your content is working or not but we also know whether research is most people don't have subscriber programs are creating a lotta content saying it out there but they're not trying to create a consistent ongoing audience base. And that's where I think we're missing out so I would look at those types of channels that can create an ongoing kind of a must see T. V. type of atmosphere. So that you can be that leading informational provider and then build an audience there that wants to tune in whenever you consistently deliver that content
